# For Interviewees
Congratulations on your choice to explore ReasonML. Sadly, I must let you know that there are very few jobs out there for these skills. A quick search on Indeed reveals fewer than 10 job listings as of this writing (February 2020). Even including job listings for pure OCaml doesn't bring the total count over 100. That said, technologies like this are rarely popular, at least initially. They require pioneers to advocate for them. You are here not to get jobs, but to become a better engineer. You are here because the world is built with software, and bad software _harms_ the world. It is easy to grind out features for uncaring companies in commodity languages such as Java or JavaScript, but it is hard to stand up and demand the time to produce quality work with quality tools.

That said, jobs are important, so you should consider ReasonML your gateway into the world of functional programming. It is here where jobs are growing and I expect them to continue growing in previously unknown heights. High quality engineers are bleeding away from the industrial languages, with some having already been more-or-less declared dead among the cognoscenti, i.e. Ruby, PHP, Perl, and Microsoft's .NET. These deaths are being sped along by major industrial companies that burn out developers with little care for personal wellbeing or the quality of what is being produced.

To facilitate your career, along with ReasonML, learn OCaml, Haskell, and Erlang. Perhaps of greatest importance are the functional languages that run on the two goliaths of industrial code: .NET and the JVM. Microsoft's .NET framework is almost nonexistant in high-tech start-ups, but it is omnipresent in the world of old, Fortune 500 companies. With it, you can run F#, which is Microsoft's version of OCaml. On the JVM, Clojure is a direct relative of ReasonML and OCaml.

## ReasonML is mostly for the front-end
If you find work in ReasonML, the companies will likely be interested in developing UI's.

## Understand recursion and recursive data
Recursion is the name of the game in the functional world, and even though ReasonML usually unrolls your recursion into normal loops, you work and think recursively.

## Understand immutable data structures
Linked lists, trees, tries, etc.
